# git-weblink

This is a command for git that gives you a web link to a commit, file or
line(s) in file.

## Setup

Make `git-weblink` globally available by adding a path to it to the `PATH`
variable in your shell. This will make it appear as a git command, and you'll
be able to run it like so:

    git weblink

## Usage

`git-weblink` can generate various links:
- link to a commit
- link to a file
- link to a line or a line range in file

Links to file or line are always generated as permalinks. There is no option to
override this behavior.

### Link to a commit

    $ git weblink -r HEAD
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/adc218676eef25575469234709c2d87185ca223a/HEAD

    $ git weblink -r v6.13
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d6cb6a3d99adf559a0a404d086f61ee3be866f86

    $ git weblink -r 35ff3b0f4596c82ec0a3e1cc43e2a85f5e976023
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/35ff3b0f4596c82ec0a3e1cc43e2a85f5e976023

### Link to a file

When no revision specified, the link will be generated for the current `HEAD`.
This means, if you are on a commit that is not pushed yet, the link will be
invalid!

    $ git weblink include/linux/kernel.h
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/adc218676eef25575469234709c2d87185ca223a/include/linux/kernel.h

Here's a link to the file on a specific revision:

    $ git weblink --rev v6.18 include/linux/kernel.h
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f7b88edb52c8dd01b7e576390d658ae6eef0e134/include/linux/kernel.h

### Link to a line or a line range

A link to a line or to a line range can be generated by adding a line number or
a line range after the file name:

    $ git weblink include/linux/kernel.h:42
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/adc218676eef25575469234709c2d87185ca223a/include/linux/kernel.h#L42

    $ git weblink include/linux/compiler.h:248-293
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/adc218676eef25575469234709c2d87185ca223a/include/linux/compiler.h#L248-L293

## Configuration

### Host-specific links

Builtin configuration includes configs for some commonly used hosts (such as
github.com, gitlab.com, etc.). But if you are hosting your own git forge, or
you are using some corporate repo that you don't want to add into the source,
you can put configuration for it into your `~/.gitconfig`:

    [weblink "https://your-forge.com"]
        commit = "{repo}/commit/{rev}"
        file = "{repo}/blob/{rev}/{path}"
        line = "{repo}/blob/{rev}/{path}#L{line}"
        range = "{repo}/blob/{rev}/{path}#L{range_begin}-L{range_end}"

Look at `HOST_CONFIGS` in `git-weblink` source for some references.

### Remote

Another thing to configure is the default remote. Most users don't need to do
anything about this. But if you have multiple remotes in your repo, and usually
want to get a link to a remote named other than `origin`, you can either
provide the remote name explicitly:

    git weblink --remote myremote ...

or you can set the default remote by running this git command:

    git config --local weblink.remote myremote

and now `myremote` will be used by default, without need to provide it
explicitly.

For example, consider the following setup for a Linux repo:

    $ git remote -v
    beagleboard     https://github.com/beagleboard/linux.git (fetch)
    beagleboard     https://github.com/beagleboard/linux.git (push)
    stable  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git (fetch)
    stable  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git (push)

and let's say that by default you want to get links to `stable` repo. In this case just run this:

    git config --local weblink.remote stable

and now links will be generated to Linux stable repo:

    $ git weblink -r v6.12.63 Makefile
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Makefile?id=6d8ac7def7031521a56bae29cadece53987bec3c

## TODO

- [ ] Add `-n`/`--nearest` option to pick a nearest commit reachable in remote
      instead of `HEAD`. This is very useful because the tip of a local branch
      is quite often not uploaded to remote yet.
- [ ] Add `black` and `mypy` (?) to github actions.
